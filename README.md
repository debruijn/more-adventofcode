# more-adventofcode
This is my repository for additional languages completing the Advent of Code challenges (https://adventofcode.com).

In my main [Advent of Code repository](https://github.com/debruijn/adventofcode), I have focused on Python, with the 
addition of some extra Rust solves for experimenting with speed increases (especially for learning how to use Rust code 
from Python).

The goal of this repo on the other hand is to have totally separate solutions in non-Python languages, to provide me 
with extra training in languages if I feel I need or want that. For example, the language-specific training like the 
Rust book or the Odin project will teach me a lot of interesting stuff, but some things I know are covered by Advent of 
Code are not a part of that. (Re)doing those challenges will force me to look up how they work in these different 
languages, and it will allow me to compare it to my Python solution as well in respect to run-speed and verbosity. Next
to do that, I might also look into alternative solutions that feel more natural within the contexts of these new
languages, such as a visual HTML solution in Javascript, or a brute force solution in Rust.

## Status per year
- 2018: Partially done in Rust in my other repo - I will in future include it in here and finish it
- 2019: In progress for JavaScript
